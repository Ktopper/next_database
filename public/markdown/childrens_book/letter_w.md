## Weighted Wolf

Weighted Wolf, with eyes bright and keen,   
Gives numbers a value, on the big screen.  
Fur soft like moonlight, a whisper so low,  
"This one is big, and that one can go!"  

Some things more important, he knows with a grin,  
Fading the rest, where wise choices begin.  
Pictures or problems, he figures it out,   
Weighted Wolf's wisdom, there's never a doubt.  

Making things clearer, with each wagging tail,  
Weighted Wolf teaches, where others may fail.

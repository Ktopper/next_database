### Chapter 3: Running

The small, run-down outpost grew larger in the ship's viewport as Aria dropped out of the intergalactic jump. The station hung in space, a haphazard collection of modules and docking bays that had seen better days. Aria's heart raced as she approached, her hands tightening on the ship's controls.

"Unidentified craft, this is Outpost Zeta-9," a gruff voice crackled over the comms. "State your identity and purpose, or be prepared to be turned away."

Aria took a deep breath, her mind spinning as she tried to come up with a plausible story. "Outpost Zeta-9, this is the starship... Celestia," she improvised, hoping the name sounded convincing. "We're independent traders, looking to make a few deals and resupply. We've got some valuable goods that might interest your clientele."

There was a pause on the other end, and Aria held her breath. Finally, the voice returned, sounding slightly more interested. "Celestia, transmit your cargo manifest and prepare for docking. Bay 14. And don't try anything funny."

"Understood, Zeta-9. Celestia out." Aria cut the transmission, her shoulders sagging with relief. She glanced over at Jace's stasis pod, silently promising him that she'd get him the help he needed.

As the ship glided into the allocated docking bay, Aria noticed a small group of workers milling about, their faces a mix of curiosity and suspicion. She put on her best confident smile as she exited the ship, her eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of trouble.

"Hey there," she called out to one of the workers, a burly man with a weathered face. "I've got a crewmate who needs some medical attention. Nothing serious, but we've been out in the black for a while. Any chance you could point me in the direction of a decent medic?"

The worker shrugged, seemingly uninterested. But before he could reply, another man stepped forward—a lean, wiry fellow with sharp eyes and a mischievous grin.

"Couldn't help but overhear," he said, his gaze darting to Aria's ship. "That's quite a beauty you've got there. I'm something of a mechanic myself, always on the lookout for interesting tech. If you let me take a peek under the hood, so to speak, I might be able to help you out with that medic."

Aria hesitated, weighing her options. She knew she couldn't trust anyone fully, but the mechanic seemed to be her best bet at getting Jace the help he needed. And if all he wanted was a look at the ship's tech, it seemed like a small price to pay.

"Alright," she agreed, nodding slowly. "You can take a look. But no touching without my permission. And I want to see this medic friend of yours first."

The mechanic's grin widened, and he extended his hand. "Name's Rix. Follow me, and I'll take you to the best medic this side of the quadrant. Just keep your end of the bargain, and we'll get along just fine."

Aria shook his hand, a flicker of unease running through her. But she pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. She had to get Jace to the medic, no matter what. And if that meant making a few deals with strangers in a seedy outpost, then so be it.

With Rix leading the way, Aria followed him into the depths of the outpost, her senses on high alert and her mind racing with possibilities. She could only hope that this gamble would pay off and that they'd find the answers they so desperately needed.

As Aria followed Rix deeper into the bowels of Outpost Zeta-9, the cramped, dimly-lit corridors seemed to close in around her. The air grew thick with the mingled scents of sweat, engine grease, and something vaguely chemical. Neon signs flickered and buzzed, advertising all manner of vices and pleasures, while the denizens of the outpost—a motley assortment of humans and aliens—eyed Aria with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

Rix navigated the labyrinthine passages with practiced ease, his wiry frame slipping through the crowds like an eel. Aria struggled to keep up, her senses on high alert as she took in the sights, sounds, and smells of the outpost's underbelly.

They passed by dingy bars where patrons drowned their sorrows in noxious-looking concoctions, and gambling dens where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye. Scantily-clad dancers writhed in the windows of pleasure houses, their movements a hypnotic blur of skin and fabric. Aria averted her gaze, focusing instead on the back of Rix's head as he led her ever deeper into the station's depths.

Despite the sensory overload, Aria couldn't shake the nagging feeling in her gut. The coordinates that had popped into her mind, leading them to this outpost—there had to be a reason. Some part of her, buried beneath the layers of missing memories, knew this place. But why? And what did it mean for their quest to uncover the truth about their identities?

Lost in thought, Aria nearly collided with Rix as he came to an abrupt halt in front of a nondescript door. The mechanic rapped out a complex pattern on the metal surface, and a moment later, the door slid open with a hiss of hydraulics.

"Doc," Rix called out, stepping inside. "Got a patient for you. And a potential client, if you play your cards right."

Aria followed him into the room, blinking as her eyes adjusted to the harsh, white light. The space was cramped but meticulously clean, filled with an array of medical equipment that looked far more advanced than anything she'd expect to find in a place like this.

A figure emerged from behind a partition, a tall, slender humanoid with pale blue skin and silvery eyes that seemed to bore into Aria's soul. The medic's gaze flicked to Rix, then back to Aria, assessing and calculating.

"What seems to be the problem?" the medic asked, his voice a melodic tenor that sent shivers down Aria's spine.

Aria stepped forward, her chin held high. "My crewmate is injured. He needs immediate medical attention. Rix here says you're the best this side of the quadrant."

The medic's lips twitched in a faint smile. "Rix is known for his exaggerations. But I am quite skilled, if I do say so myself. Where is this crewmate of yours?"

"Back on our ship. He's in stasis, but I don't know how long it will hold." Aria's voice wavered slightly, betraying her concern.

---

The medic nodded, already moving to gather his equipment. "I'll come to your ship with my portable medbay. It's the best way to treat your crewmate without drawing unwanted attention. But my services don't come cheap, especially for unregistered vessels and their mysterious crews."

Aria's heart sank, but she forced herself to meet the medic's gaze. "We have valuable tech onboard. Enough to make it worth your while."

The medic paused, considering. "Very well. Lead the way to your ship. We'll see if we can come to an arrangement."

As Aria turned to leave, the medic called out to a shadowy corner of the room. "KL-33, prepare the portable medbay for transport."

A spindly, rust-colored droid emerged from the darkness, its movements jerky and uncoordinated. It wobbled over to a cylindrical device, extending its arms to lift the portable medbay.

Aria eyed the droid skeptically. "Are you sure that thing can handle the medbay? It looks like it's about to fall apart."

The medic chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "KL-33 may not be pretty, but it's reliable. It was a riot control droid back in the day, used in some of the toughest penal colonies in the sector. Reprogrammed it myself. It'll get the job done and ensure payment is received. It can be quite... persuasive when it needs to be."

Aria swallowed hard, a flicker of unease running through her. But she pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. She had to get Jace the help he needed, no matter what.

As they made their way back to the docking bay, the medic called out once more. "Oh, and one more thing. I'll need a name for my records. Just a formality, you understand."

Aria hesitated, her mind racing. "Call me... Nova. Nova Starlighter."

The name felt strange on her tongue, but somehow, it also felt right. Like a piece of a puzzle falling into place, even if she couldn't see the whole picture yet.

With a nod to Rix and the medic, Aria hurried back to the ship, the droid and its portable medbay in tow. Her thoughts were a whirlwind of anticipation and trepidation. 

As they approached the ship, Aria's heart raced with a mix of hope and fear. The medic and his unsettling droid represented a chance to save Jace, but the uncertainty of his condition weighed heavily on her mind. She had no idea how severe his injury truly was or what kind of treatment he would require. The thought of losing him, of being alone in this strange and dangerous universe, sent a chill down her spine.

As the group boarded the ship, Aria led the medic and his droid to the room where Jace lay in stasis. The sight of his still, pale form sent a pang of worry through her heart. She could only hope that the medic's skills would be enough to bring him back from the brink.

The medic set to work, his expression focused and intent as he examined Jace's wound and vital signs. KL-33 stood nearby, its glowing eyes fixed on Aria as if assessing her every move.

Minutes ticked by, each one feeling like an eternity as Aria watched and waited. The medic's brow furrowed, and he muttered something under his breath that Aria couldn't quite catch.

Finally, he straightened up, his gaze meeting Aria's. "Your friend is lucky," he said, his voice grave. "The stasis pod kept his condition from deteriorating, but he's not out of the woods yet. I've done what I can for now, but he'll need further treatment and rest to fully recover."

Aria nodded, relief and gratitude washing over her. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "I don't know what we would have done without your help."

The medic's lips twitched in a faint smile. "Don't thank me yet. We still have the matter of payment to discuss."

With a deep breath, she met the medic's gaze head-on. "Let's talk," she said, her voice steady and determined. "I'm sure we can come to an arrangement."

With a deep breath, she met the medic's gaze head-on. "Of course," she said, her voice steady and determined. "What did you have in mind?"

The medic's eyes gleamed with a calculating light. "That depends on what you have to offer. You mentioned valuable tech onboard your ship. I might be interested in taking a look."

Aria hesitated, glancing around the room. She knew that the ship held secrets, advanced technology that she and Jace had barely begun to understand. But if it meant saving his life...

"I can show you," she said slowly, choosing her words carefully. "But I need your assurance that this stays between us. No one else can know about what you see here."

The medic nodded, his expression serious. "Doctor-patient confidentiality is sacred to me. Whatever I learn here will remain strictly confidential."

Aria let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. "All right, then. Follow me."

As she led the medic and KL-33 through the ship's corridors, Aria's mind raced with possibilities and fears. What would the medic make of the advanced technology they had stumbled upon? Would it be enough to cover Jace's treatment?

And then there were the larger questions, the ones that had haunted her since she first awoke on this ship with no memory of her past. Who was she, really? Why had she and Jace been targeted, their memories erased? What secrets lay hidden in the depths of their own minds, waiting to be unlocked?

Aria shook her head, pushing those thoughts aside for now. She had to focus on the present, on the immediate challenge of convincing the medic to help them without revealing too much.

### Chapter 3: Running

The small, run-down outpost grew larger in the ship's viewport as Aria dropped out of the intergalactic jump. The station hung in space, a haphazard collection of modules and docking bays that had seen better days. Aria's heart raced as she approached, her hands tightening on the ship's controls.

"Unidentified craft, this is Outpost Zeta-9," a gruff voice crackled over the comms. "State your identity and purpose, or be prepared to be turned away."

Aria took a deep breath, her mind spinning as she tried to come up with a plausible story. "Outpost Zeta-9, this is the starship... Celestia," she improvised, hoping the name sounded convincing. "We're independent traders, looking to make a few deals and resupply. We've got some valuable goods that might interest your clientele."

There was a pause on the other end, and Aria held her breath. Finally, the voice returned, sounding slightly more interested. "Celestia, transmit your cargo manifest and prepare for docking. Bay 14. And don't try anything funny."

"Understood, Zeta-9. Celestia out." Aria cut the transmission, her shoulders sagging with relief. She glanced over at Jace's stasis pod, silently promising him that she'd get him the help he needed.

As the ship glided into the allocated docking bay, Aria noticed a small group of workers milling about, their faces a mix of curiosity and suspicion. She put on her best confident smile as she exited the ship, her eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of trouble.

"Hey there," she called out to one of the workers, a burly man with a weathered face. "I've got a crewmate who needs some medical attention. Nothing serious, but we've been out in the black for a while. Any chance you could point me in the direction of a decent medic?"

The worker shrugged, seemingly uninterested. But before he could reply, another man stepped forward—a lean, wiry fellow with sharp eyes and a mischievous grin.

"Couldn't help but overhear," he said, his gaze darting to Aria's ship. "That's quite a beauty you've got there. I'm something of a mechanic myself, always on the lookout for interesting tech. If you let me take a peek under the hood, so to speak, I might be able to help you out with that medic."

Aria hesitated, weighing her options. She knew she couldn't trust anyone fully, but the mechanic seemed to be her best bet at getting Jace the help he needed. And if all he wanted was a look at the ship's tech, it seemed like a small price to pay.

"Alright," she agreed, nodding slowly. "You can take a look. But no touching without my permission. And I want to see this medic friend of yours first."

The mechanic's grin widened, and he extended his hand. "Name's Rix. Follow me, and I'll take you to the best medic this side of the quadrant. Just keep your end of the bargain, and we'll get along just fine."

Aria shook his hand, a flicker of unease running through her. But she pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. She had to get Jace to the medic, no matter what. And if that meant making a few deals with strangers in a seedy outpost, then so be it.

With Rix leading the way, Aria followed him into the depths of the outpost, her senses on high alert and her mind racing with possibilities. She could only hope that this gamble would pay off and that they'd find the answers they so desperately needed.

---

As Aria followed Rix deeper into the bowels of Outpost Zeta-9, the cramped, dimly-lit corridors seemed to close in around her. The air grew thick with the mingled scents of sweat, engine grease, and something vaguely chemical. Neon signs flickered and buzzed, advertising all manner of vices and pleasures, while the denizens of the outpost—a motley assortment of humans and aliens—eyed Aria with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.

Rix navigated the labyrinthine passages with practiced ease, his wiry frame slipping through the crowds like an eel. Aria struggled to keep up, her senses on high alert as she took in the sights, sounds, and smells of the outpost's underbelly.

They passed by dingy bars where patrons drowned their sorrows in noxious-looking concoctions, and gambling dens where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye. Scantily-clad dancers writhed in the windows of pleasure houses, their movements a hypnotic blur of skin and fabric. Aria averted her gaze, focusing instead on the back of Rix's head as he led her ever deeper into the station's depths.

Despite the sensory overload, Aria couldn't shake the nagging feeling in her gut. The coordinates that had popped into her mind, leading them to this outpost—there had to be a reason. Some part of her, buried beneath the layers of missing memories, knew this place. But why? And what did it mean for their quest to uncover the truth about their identities?

Lost in thought, Aria nearly collided with Rix as he came to an abrupt halt in front of a nondescript door. The mechanic rapped out a complex pattern on the metal surface, and a moment later, the door slid open with a hiss of hydraulics.

"Doc," Rix called out, stepping inside. "Got a patient for you. And a potential client, if you play your cards right."

Aria followed him into the room, blinking as her eyes adjusted to the harsh, white light. The space was cramped but meticulously clean, filled with an array of medical equipment that looked far more advanced than anything she'd expect to find in a place like this.

A figure emerged from behind a partition, a tall, slender humanoid with pale blue skin and silvery eyes that seemed to bore into Aria's soul. The medic's gaze flicked to Rix, then back to Aria, assessing and calculating.

"What seems to be the problem?" the medic asked, his voice a melodic tenor that sent shivers down Aria's spine.

Aria stepped forward, her chin held high. "My crewmate is injured. He needs immediate medical attention. Rix here says you're the best this side of the quadrant."

The medic's lips twitched in a faint smile. "Rix is known for his exaggerations. But I am quite skilled, if I do say so myself. Where is this crewmate of yours?"

"Back on our ship. He's in stasis, but I don't know how long it will hold." Aria's voice wavered slightly, betraying her concern.

---

The medic nodded, already moving to gather his equipment. "I'll come to your ship with my portable medbay. It's the best way to treat your crewmate without drawing unwanted attention. But my services don't come cheap, especially for unregistered vessels and their mysterious crews."

Aria's heart sank, but she forced herself to meet the medic's gaze. "We have valuable tech onboard. Enough to make it worth your while."

The medic paused, considering. "Very well. Lead the way to your ship. We'll see if we can come to an arrangement."

As Aria turned to leave, the medic called out to a shadowy corner of the room. "KL-33, prepare the portable medbay for transport."

A spindly, rust-colored droid emerged from the darkness, its movements jerky and uncoordinated. It wobbled over to a cylindrical device, extending its arms to lift the portable medbay.

Aria eyed the droid skeptically. "Are you sure that thing can handle the medbay? It looks like it's about to fall apart."

The medic chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "KL-33 may not be pretty, but it's reliable. It was a riot control droid back in the day, used in some of the toughest penal colonies in the sector. Reprogrammed it myself. It'll get the job done and ensure payment is received. It can be quite... persuasive when it needs to be."

Aria swallowed hard, a flicker of unease running through her. But she pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. She had to get Jace the help he needed, no matter what.

As they made their way back to the docking bay, the medic called out once more. "Oh, and one more thing. I'll need a name for my records. Just a formality, you understand."

Aria hesitated, her mind racing. "Call me... Nova. Nova Starlighter."

The name felt strange on her tongue, but somehow, it also felt right. Like a piece of a puzzle falling into place, even if she couldn't see the whole picture yet.

With a nod to Rix and the medic, Aria hurried back to the ship, the droid and its portable medbay in tow. Her thoughts were a whirlwind of anticipation and trepidation. 

As they approached the ship, Aria's heart raced with a mix of hope and fear. The medic and his unsettling droid represented a chance to save Jace, but the uncertainty of his condition weighed heavily on her mind. She had no idea how severe his injury truly was or what kind of treatment he would require. The thought of losing him, of being alone in this strange and dangerous universe, sent a chill down her spine.

As the group boarded the ship, Aria led the medic and his droid to the room where Jace lay in stasis. The sight of his still, pale form sent a pang of worry through her heart. She could only hope that the medic's skills would be enough to bring him back from the brink.

The medic set to work, his expression focused and intent as he examined Jace's wound and vital signs. KL-33 stood nearby, its glowing eyes fixed on Aria as if assessing her every move.

Minutes ticked by, each one feeling like an eternity as Aria watched and waited. The medic's brow furrowed, and he muttered something under his breath that Aria couldn't quite catch.

Finally, he straightened up, his gaze meeting Aria's. "Your friend is lucky," he said, his voice grave. "The stasis pod kept his condition from deteriorating, but he's not out of the woods yet. I've done what I can for now, but he'll need further treatment and rest to fully recover."

Aria nodded, relief and gratitude washing over her. "Thank you," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "I don't know what we would have done without your help."

The medic's lips twitched in a faint smile. "Don't thank me yet. We still have the matter of payment to discuss."

With a deep breath, she met the medic's gaze head-on. "Let's talk," she said, her voice steady and determined. "I'm sure we can come to an arrangement."

With a deep breath, she met the medic's gaze head-on. "Of course," she said, her voice steady and determined. "What did you have in mind?"

The medic's eyes gleamed with a calculating light. "That depends on what you have to offer. You mentioned valuable tech onboard your ship. I might be interested in taking a look."

Aria hesitated, glancing around the room. She knew that the ship held secrets, advanced technology that she and Jace had barely begun to understand. But if it meant saving his life...

"I can show you," she said slowly, choosing her words carefully. "But I need your assurance that this stays between us. No one else can know about what you see here."

The medic nodded, his expression serious. "Doctor-patient confidentiality is sacred to me. Whatever I learn here will remain strictly confidential."

Aria let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. "All right, then. Follow me."

As she led the medic and KL-33 through the ship's corridors, Aria's mind raced with possibilities and fears. What would the medic make of the advanced technology they had stumbled upon? Would it be enough to cover Jace's treatment?

And then there were the larger questions, the ones that had haunted her since she first awoke on this ship with no memory of her past. Who was she, really? Why had she and Jace been targeted, their memories erased? What secrets lay hidden in the depths of their own minds, waiting to be unlocked?

Aria shook her head, pushing those thoughts aside for now. She had to focus on the present, on the immediate challenge of convincing the medic to help them without revealing too much.

Rix immediately set to work, rummaging through the boxes with a practiced eye. He let out a low whistle as he pried open one of the crates, revealing a sleek, high-tech weapon nestled inside. "Well, well, well," he murmured, glancing up at Aria with a raised eyebrow. "What have we here?"

Aria shifted uncomfortably, her gaze flickering between Rix and the medic. "I... I didn't know those were there," she said honestly, her voice tight with confusion. "We're not gun runners. At least, I don't think we are."

The medic stepped closer, peering at the weapon with a clinical eye. "These are no ordinary firearms," he said, his tone laced with interest. "The technology is far beyond anything I've seen on the black market."

Rix nodded, his expression thoughtful. "This could cover your friend's treatment and then some," he said, turning to Aria. "But it raises some interesting questions about who you really are and what you're doing with this kind of cargo."

As the group huddled around the crate of advanced weapons, a sudden explosion rocked the ship, sending them stumbling. The cargo hold lights flickered, and a new alarm blared through the corridors, this one deeper and more insistent than the ship's internal warning system.

Rix's eyes widened, his face draining of color. "That's the station's emergency alert," he said, his voice tight with fear. "Something big is going down out there."

Aria's heart raced as she steadied herself against a nearby crate. "What do you mean? What's happening?"

The medic's expression turned grim. "It's the Consortium," he said, his voice low and urgent. "They're here, on the station. And if they find us with these weapons..."

Aria's heart raced as she took in Rix's ashen face, the fear etched into his features speaking volumes about the severity of the situation. The Consortium, whoever they were, had the power to strike terror into the hearts of even the most hardened denizens of the galactic underworld.

"The Consortium?" Aria asked, her voice tight with tension. "Who are they?"

Rix shook his head, his eyes darting nervously towards the cargo hold door. "Bad news, that's who. They're like the intergalactic mafia, but with a badge. They say they enforce the law, but they're just as dirty as the criminals they hunt. And if they find us with these weapons..."

He didn't need to finish the sentence. Aria could see the implications written in the lines of his face, the fear that drained the color from his cheeks.

The medic stepped forward, his expression grave. "We can't stay here," he said, his voice low and urgent. "If the Consortium is raiding the station, it's only a matter of time before they find your ship. We need to get off this rock, now."

Aria hesitated, her mind racing. Taking off in the middle of a firefight was risky, especially with Jace's condition still so fragile. But the alternative - being caught by the Consortium with a hold full of illegal weapons - was even worse.

She turned to Rix, her jaw set with determination. "Can you fly this thing?"

Rix blinked, surprise flickering across his features. "I... I think so. I've flown my fair share of ships, but..."

"Good," Aria cut him off, her voice brooking no argument. "Get to the cockpit and start the engines. Doc, help me get Jace strapped in. We're getting out of here."

The medic nodded, already moving towards Jace's unconscious form. Rix hesitated a moment longer, his gaze darting between Aria and the crate of weapons.

"What about the cargo?" he asked, his voice strained.

Aria's lips thinned into a tight line. "We'll worry about that later," she said, her tone leaving no room for debate. "Right now, our priority is survival."

With a final nod, Rix turned and sprinted towards the cockpit, his footsteps echoing in the cramped corridors of the ship. Aria and the medic worked quickly, strapping Jace securely into a nearby seat and double-checking his vital signs.

The sound of blaster fire and shouting grew louder, the chaos of the station bleeding through the ship's walls. Aria's heart pounded in her chest, adrenaline coursing through her veins as she finished securing Jace and raced towards the cockpit.

She slid into the co-pilot's seat just as Rix fired up the engines, the ship humming to life beneath them. His hands flew over the controls, his brow furrowed in concentration as he plotted their escape route.

"Hang on," he muttered, his voice tight with strain. "This is going to be a bumpy ride."

Aria gripped the armrests of her seat, her knuckles turning white as the ship lifted off the landing pad, the force of acceleration pressing her back into the cushions.

They burst out of the hangar bay, the blackness of space enveloping them like a cloak. But even as they put distance between themselves and the station, Aria couldn't shake the feeling that they were leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire.

Beside her, Rix let out a shaky breath, his hands trembling slightly on the controls. "We did it," he muttered, disbelief coloring his tone. "We actually did it."

But even as the words left his lips, the ship's sensor array lit up like a Festive Tree, warning lights flashing across the console. Aria leaned forward, her eyes scanning the readouts with a growing sense of dread.

"We've got company," she said, her voice taut with tension. "Three ships, closing fast. They must have followed us out of the station."

Rix cursed under his breath, his fingers flying over the controls as he tried to coax more speed out of the engines. "Can we outrun them?"

Aria shook her head, her gaze fixed on the sensor display. "Not a chance. They're faster and more maneuverable than we are."

Suddenly, a thought occurred to her, a flash of intuition that sent a shiver down her spine. Her eyes darted to the weapons console, a panel she had barely noticed before in the chaos of their escape.

Without thinking, she reached out and flipped a switch, the console humming to life beneath her fingers. A targeting display flickered into existence, the incoming ships represented as glowing red dots against a sea of black.

Aria's breath caught in her throat, a strange sense of familiarity washing over her. It was as if she had done this a thousand times before, her hands moving over the controls with a surety and precision that belied her lack of conscious memory.

Rix glanced over at her, his eyes widening in surprise. "You know how to work that thing?"

Aria hesitated, the realization sending a thrill of both excitement and fear through her veins. "I... I think so," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It feels... natural, somehow."

As if to punctuate her words, the ship shuddered beneath them, the sound of laser fire echoing through the hull. The Consortium ships had opened fire, their weapons tearing through the void with deadly accuracy.

Aria's fingers tightened on the controls, her jaw clenching with determination. She swung the targeting reticle towards the nearest ship, the weapons console beeping softly as it locked on.

With a deep breath, she squeezed the trigger, a lance of energy leaping from their ship's guns and slamming into the Consortium vessel. The enemy ship shuddered, its shields flickering under the onslaught.

Rix let out a whoop of triumph, his face breaking into a grin. "Nice shot!"

But Aria barely heard him, her focus narrowing to the dance of combat, the ebb and flow of attack and defense. She fired again and again, her shots finding their marks with uncanny precision.

One by one, the Consortium ships fell away, their hulls battered and smoking. Aria's heart raced, a fierce joy surging through her veins. For the first time since she had awoken on this strange journey, she felt truly alive, truly in control.

But even as the last enemy ship limped away, its engines sputtering and dying, Aria couldn't shake the sense of unease that lingered at the back of her mind. The ease with which she had taken to the weapons, the instinctive way her hands had moved over the controls...

It was as if a part of her had always known how to fight, how to kill. And that realization brought with it a host of new questions, new doubts about who she really was and what she had been before.

Rix's hands flew over the navigation controls, his brow furrowed in concentration as he plotted a course to a distant sector, far from the reach of the Consortium's grasp. With a final, decisive keystroke, he engaged the jump drive, the stars outside the viewport blurring into long streaks of light as the ship hurtled through the fabric of space-time.

As the jump completed and the ship settled into its new course, Rix leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the swirling vortex of hyperspace outside the viewport. For a long moment, he was silent, the only sound the gentle hum of the ship's engines.

Finally, he turned to Aria, his expression a mix of confusion, suspicion, and something else - a hint of awe, perhaps, or even fear.

"Okay, I need some answers," he said, his voice low and intense. "What the hell was that back there? And who are you, really? Because this sure as hell isn't your ship."

Aria opened her mouth to respond, but Rix held up a hand, cutting her off.

"Don't give me that 'I don't remember' crap," he said, his eyes narrowing. "You walk around on this ship like it's brand new to you, like you've never seen it before. But then you go and pull off those moves with the weapons system, like it's second nature to you."

He leaned forward, his gaze boring into hers. "And why is the Consortium after you? They had no interest in our outpost before you showed up. Hell, I'm not even sure it's an outpost anymore, after what just happened."

Aria felt a flicker of guilt, a twinge of responsibility for the chaos they had left in their wake. But she pushed it aside, focusing on the question at hand.

"I wish I had answers for you, Rix," she said, her voice steady despite the turmoil raging inside her. "But the truth is, I don't know who I am, or why the Consortium is after us. All I know is that Jace and I woke up on this ship with no memory of how we got here, or what we were doing before."

She hesitated, her gaze dropping to her hands. "As for the weapons... I can't explain it. It was like muscle memory, like my body knew what to do even if my mind didn't. I don't know what that means, or what it says about who I was before."

Rix studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Finally, he let out a sigh, leaning back in his chair.

"Well, whoever you were, you sure as hell know how to handle yourself in a fight," he said, a hint of grudging respect in his tone. "And right now, that's good enough for me."

He glanced over his shoulder, towards the rear of the ship where Jace lay unconscious in the medbay. "But your friend back there... he's a different story. The doc said there was something weird about his physiology, something he couldn't quite figure out."

Aria felt a chill run down her spine, a flicker of unease that she couldn't quite put a name to. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Rix shrugged, his expression grim. "I don't know. But whatever it is, it's not normal. And if the Consortium is after you because of it..."

He let the thought hang in the air, unfinished but heavy with implication.

Aria swallowed hard, her mind racing with possibilities. The mystery of Jace's condition, the secrets locked away in their missing memories... it all swirled together in a dizzying maelstrom of questions and uncertainty.

But one thing was clear. Whatever lay ahead, whatever challenges they faced, they would have to face them together. And with Rix by their side, a newfound ally in a galaxy full of dangers, perhaps they stood a chance.

Even if the truth remained elusive, always just out of reach.
